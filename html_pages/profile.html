                          <h3>Bio</h3>
                          <p>Ever since I was a little kid, software development has been my passion. I still remember sitting in front of an Atari 800 computer, with the BASIC cartridge loaded in, making it print "Hello, Dan" for the very first time. As I went through the BASIC tutorial, it was almost magic, being able to get the computer to do whatever I wanted, just by typing in these funny little symbols, limited only by my own imagination and ingenuity.</p>
                          <p>Throughout middle and high school, I latched on to any ideas for projects I could get, moving from "Hello World" all the way to a simple First Person Shooter engine, with dozens of projects in between. I learned C, then C++, tearing through any books I could find on anything remotely related to software development. I was insatiable.</p>

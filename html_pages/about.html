											<h3>Charitable Giving is Contagious</h3>
											<p> In fact, a study (by James Fowler of the University of California, San Diego and Nicholas Christakis of Harvard) published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science confirms this.  The way we see it play out is that often when we are able to give to a project early, it inspires others around us to give as well. I learned that firsthand with a project collaboration with the Denver Museum of Nature and Science.</p>

											<h3>Meet the Team</h3>
											<p>The four founding fathers of Chipin are Khidr Brinkley, Alex Gray, Luke Parker, and Nyein (ninja) Chan. We worked diligently and our coding skills were pushed to the absolute limit. Each of the founding fathers invested their valuable time in order to turn their dream of a cutting-edge donation platform into a reality. ChipIn will continue to grow and change the world.</p>

										<h3>ChipIn With Us</h3>
										<p>When considering poverty in the developing world, many people feel deep sorrow but conclude that there is nothing we can do. The scale of poverty is immense and we seem powerless to stop it. Such despair is understandable, but the facts tell a very different story. While poverty is indeed extreme and widespread, it is easy to forget just how many people there are in the developed world, and how powerful our pocket change can become when pooled together.</p>
										<p>When giving to an effective charity, the size of your donation directly correlates with the number of people you are able to help. But you don’t have to be a millionaire to make a significant difference. Even small donations have the potential to drastically improve an individual’s quality of life.</p>
										<h3>Our Core Values</h3>
										<p>Our values show what we believe in here at ChipIn. It’s the backbone which can be referred back to as context if ever you are confused about what we stand for. These values demonstrate how we act and who we are as an entity. It as a set of guidelines which demonstrate the “soul” of the company to whoever reads it.</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Learn: We learn different ways to impact the world on a daily basis.</li>
											<li>Reach: We effectively reach as many people as possible.</li>
											<li>Diversity: We strongly believe in diversification.</li>
											<li>Empathy: We genuinely care for others.</li>
											<li>We are one global network.</li>
